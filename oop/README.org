This directory contains code for an OOP wrapper over the lower-level bindings in the =libgccjit= directory. The main goal is to make the API better by:
- Abstracting out compilation contexts using the garbage collector and dynamic variables
- Use lists instead of C arrays to minimize overhead
- Make functions generic where feasible
- Make intermediate objects into GOOPS objects
- Use keyword arguments to not force null locations to be passed everywhere
- Generally make things more scheme-ish
